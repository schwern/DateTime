TODO list for Perl module DateTime

* strftime method

- more tests for other languages


* Other

- sub-second resolution - at least microseconds (cooperate with
Time::HiRes), but is micro small enough?

- overloading for DateTime::Duration: multiplication (duration * int),
division? (duration / int).

- document RD days/seconds(/nanosecs?) in a separate document that
will be the reference for DateTime.pm internals, as well as being
useful for other calendar implementors.

- Time::Local is now a core module, with no CPAN existence.  But the
version that works best is in 5.8.0, and not otherwise available.

- thorough tests for subtraction & addition overloading

- handle leap seconds

- by default, reject out of bounds datetime values (minute 75) but
offer a "normalize" parameter that will wrap these.


NOTE TO FUTURE DEVELOPERS:

Attempting to implement add_duration in XS actually seemed to slow
date math operations down.  Sad but true.
