- Giving a language parameter to a constructor method didn't load the
language class.

- Test that all language classes are at least loadable.

- Added Brazilian (not quite a language ;) and Danish, again stolen
from Graham Barr's TimeDate suite.

- Added is_dst method.  Requested by Matt Sergeant.

- Fixed a bug in calculating day of year in leap years (it was +1 off
starting in February).  Reported by Matt Sergeant.

- Subtracting one datetime from another was broken in most cases.
Improved the tests for this quite a bit.  Reported by Eric Cholet.

- Made the version number a non-dev-release so it's visible when
CPAN.pm tries to install it as a prereq for something else.

0.01_00  2003-02-04

- The first alpha release.  This module draws on Date::ICal for much
of its internals, so it has more history than a normal alpha release.
