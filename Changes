[IMPROVEMENTS]

- Added a small hack to the compare() method so that this module can
be used with Set::Infinite.

- Changed compare so that it can be used to compare two objects from
different calendars that conform to the DateTime::Calendar interface.

- Added explanation of exactly what calendar this module represents
("proleptic Gregorian calendar") to docs.

- Added a Spanish language DateTime::Language subclass.  Implemented
by Flavio S. Glock.

- Added support for specifying a language by ISO code ("en" or
"pt-br") as well as the subclass name.  Based on a patch from Erich
Cholet.

- Revamped the externally visible DateTime::Language API.

- Objects created via the from_object() method are set to the time
zone of the object from which they were created, if it has one, or UTC
otherwise.

[BUG FIXES]

- The from_object() method was broken because it retrieved a UTC
datetime from the object passed in, and then created a new DateTime
object using that UTC time as a _local_ time.

[BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

- Removed stringification overloading.  Having this in place made it
impossible to create a strack trace in much of the time zone code.

- Renamed the DateTime::Language->subclasses method as languages.

- It is no longer possible to directly instantiate a
DateTime::Language subclass, instead use:

  my $en = DateTime::Language->new( language => 'English' );

- The from_object() method no longer accepts a "time_zone" parameter.

- The docs said that there was no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar,
but that was wrong.  The year() method can now return 0.  The year_0()
method has been removed.

- Added jd() and mjd() methods.

- Re-implemented some of the core code in XS for speed.

- Fix handling and reporting of epoch times.  Epoch times are, by
definition, UTC times, so any time created from an epoch should always
have its time zone set to "UTC".  This can be changed after the object
is created.  Similarly, value returned by the epoch() method needs to
be based on the object's UTC time, not it's local time.  Bug reported
by Kellan Elliott-McCrea.

- Change year_0 so that -1 BCE is 0, not 1 CE.  This corresponds to
astronomical years.

- Change ymd, dmy, mdy, and iso8601 to use Gregorian years (..., -2,
-1, 1, 2, ... ) as opposed to astronomical years.  Also make sure all
negative years are formatted as 4 digits.

0.04     2003-02-10

- Explicitly set time zone for objects created during tests.

0.03     2003-02-09

- Giving a language parameter to a constructor method didn't load the
language class.

- Test that all language classes are at least loadable.

- Added Brazilian (not quite a language ;) and Danish, again stolen
from Graham Barr's TimeDate suite.

- Added is_dst method.  Requested by Matt Sergeant.

0.02     2003-02-09

- Fixed a bug in calculating day of year in leap years (it was +1 off
starting in February).  Reported by Matt Sergeant.

- Subtracting one datetime from another was broken in most cases.
Improved the tests for this quite a bit.  Reported by Eric Cholet.

- Made the version number a non-dev-release so it's visible when
CPAN.pm tries to install it as a prereq for something else.

0.01_00  2003-02-04

- The first alpha release.  This module draws on Date::ICal for much
of its internals, so it has more history than a normal alpha release.
